My 1

Your 2

I 25

twenty 2
dollars, 2

necessary 1
save 1
your 14

Before 1

Dear 1
Johnston:-- 1
request 1
eighty 3
do 7
think 2
best 3
comply 1
now. 1
At 1
various 1
times 2
when 1
helped 1
little, 1
said 1
me, 2
"We 1
get 7
along 1
now," 1
but 3
short 1
time 1
find 2
difficulty 1
again. 2
Now 2
this 5
only 1
happen 1
some 2
defect 2
conduct. 1
What 1
is, 2
know. 2
You 7
_lazy_, 1
still 3
_are_ 1
an 2
_idler_. 1
doubt 1
whether 1
since 1
saw 1
you, 2
done 2
good 1
whole 2
day's 1
work, 3
any 4
one 2
much 2
dislike 1
work 2
much, 1
merely 1
because 2
does 1
seem 1
could 1
This 1
habit 3
uselessly 1
wasting 1
time, 2
difficulty; 1
vastly 1
important 2
children, 1
break 1
habit. 1
them, 1
they 5
longer 1
live, 1
keep 2
out 3
idle 1
easier 1
than 3
after 1
in. 1
now 6
need 1
ready 1
money; 1
what 3
propose 1
shall 3
go 4
"tooth 1
nail," 1
somebody 1
who 1
give 3
money 5
Let 1
father 1
boys 1
take 1
charge 1
things 1
home--prepare 1
crop, 1
make 2
crop; 1
wages, 1
or 10
discharge 1
debt 2
owe, 1
get. 1
And 2
secure 1
fair 1
reward 1
labor, 1
promise 1
every 1
dollar 1
will, 1
between 1
first 1
next 2
May, 1
own 2
labor 1
either 1
indebtedness, 1
then 2
other 1
dollar. 1
this, 4
if 6
hire 1
yourself 1
ten 2
dollars 4
month, 1
me 3
more, 1
making 1
month 1
work. 2
In 1

County. 1
soon 1
debt, 1
better, 1
getting 1
But 1
clear 1
out, 1
year 1
just 2
deep 1
ever. 1
almost 1
place 2
Heaven 2
$70 1
$80. 1
Then 1
value 1
cheaply, 1
am 2
offer 1
seventy 1
four 1
five 1
months' 1
furnish 1
deed 1
land, 2
don't 1
back, 1
deliver 1
possession--Nonsense! 1
If 2
can't 1
live 2
_with_ 1
how 1
without 1
it? 1
been 1
kind 1
unkind 1
you. 4
On 1
